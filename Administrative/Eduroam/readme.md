This folder was made in order to help when trying to connect to EDUROAM (Sorbonne Universite's WIFI) for the first time. The procedure is different depending on what your software is (Windows, MacOS, IOS, Android). You have to pick the right pdf file for you.

Moreover, there is often variability in the login procedure depending on your affiliation. For example, for a user named _Elvis Presley_, the login may be 'epresley' at UGA or 'elvis.presley@locean.ipsl.fr' at LOCEAN. This discrepancy frequently leads to errors when attempting to connect to eduroam.
