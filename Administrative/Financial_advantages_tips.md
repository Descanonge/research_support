There are some advantages to working in public academia (from the day you start your PhD):

- Access to the CAES of CNRS, which is equivalent to the Employee Committee (CE) of a regular company. To access it, you need to create an account on the CNRS portal (https://intranet.cnrs.fr/Vie_interne/caes/Pages/default.aspx). From this website, you can:
    - Request Ch√®ques Vacances, which must be applied for before the end of the year for the following year (based on your tax declaration), via CAES.
    - Explore holiday accommodations such as gites and special places accessible via CNRS at discounted rates, also through CAES.
    - Purchase discounted tickets for cinemas and theatres.

- Being affiliated with a research institute allows you to request reductions for gym memberships. This can be done through *le Guichet sportif* (https://www.leguichetsport.com/qui-sommes-nous.php).
