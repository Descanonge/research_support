The essential step upon arriving at a new laboratory is to obtain a canteen card, allowing you to enjoy a good meal at a reasonable price alongside your colleagues.

While procedures may change over time, currently, if you belong to DR2 (which is the most likely scenario), you should contact the restauration department at `dr02restauration@dr2.cnrs.fr`. Request access to *la cantine du personnel du CROUS de Jussieu*. Individuals with contracts affiliated with CROUS (such as any CNRS contract, even from another city than Paris) are eligible for access to the CROUS facilities at Jussieu. 

If you receive no response, attempt to contact the following email address: "Sorbonne Universit√©, DDRH - SIRH" <ddrh-sirh@sorbonne-universite.fr>.
