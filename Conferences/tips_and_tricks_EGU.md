Before EGU
==========

Preparing your personal programme
---------------------------------
You can find all events/sessions/presentations taking place under this link: https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/meetingprogramme.\
However, the search tool is not very optimal as you can only choose one date and programme group at a time if I understood it right… So you’ll have to check it out step-by-step. To save a session or a special presentation, you just need to click on the star and this way it will be saved to your personal programme.\
To help you understand what you are looking for, I quickly want to present the different types of events (see: https://egu24.eu/about/meeting_format.html): 

- Scientific sessions: this is where the people present the science. There are three different ways to present it: presentation (10 min incl. questions), poster or PICO (an interactive poster, a bit halfway between poster and presentation).
- Union symposia, great debates, medal lectures, etc.: These are long presentations where everyone can attend. They are made for a large scientific public on larger topics and I often find them interesting.
- Short courses: these are nice hands-on events to learn a skill in a small group or hear about career panels and such things. They are usually organised by Early Career Scientists and very practical and helpful. I recommend them as well!
- Division meetings: The EGU is divided in several divisions (https://www.egu.eu/structure/divisions/). Each of these divisions is meeting during the EGU General Assembly. They are open to everyone and you can attend the Division meetings you feel you might be closest to if you are interested in what happens behind the curtains at EGU when it is not EGU week.
- Networking events: I’ll write about them in the Section *During EGU*.

Still, there are a lot of programme points and it is easy to be overwhelmed. What I generally do is that I search for keywords in the search box https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/meetingprogramme, e.g.  “Antarctica”, “ice shelves” or people I know or have heard of in the field. This helps finding the most interesting sessions/presentations for me. And then, as a second step, I skim through the sessions of the EGU Divisions that I feel closest to (me personally CR, CL, AS and OS) and through the Symposia/Great Debates/Short courses/etc.

Preparing your presentation/poster/PICO
---------------------------------------
I find EGU very overwhelming and sometimes a bit disappointing because there are sooooo many people and they come from so many different fields that most of the questions tend to be very shallow and not necessarily expert. Still, it is a good exercise to bring your topic to a bit larger audience. Also, it is YOUR opportunity to be seen in the scientific community. So, keep that in mind when preparing your presentation/poster/PICO. Make a good presentation and the people (from your field and maybe also outside) will remember you!

Have a look at the EGU Geolog blog
----------------------------------
It has a lot of useful information about EGU, especially in the few weeks before: https://blogs.egu.eu/geolog/. I really recommend it!

During EGU
==========

Getting the hang of it
----------------------
If you are here for the first time I strongly recommend that you attend the short course:" How to navigate EGU: tips and tricks". 

Your presentation/poster
------------------------
Make the best of it! :) Take advantage of the discussions happening in your session to get to know other people in your field. It is a great place to get to know people from all career stages interested in similar science as you!

Networking events
-----------------
EGU is great to meet new and "old" people and there are a lot of events to promote networking!\
Each division has two networking events during EGU: one for Early-Career Scientists (ECS) only and one for both ECS and senior scientists. You can find the timing of these events under the option “Networking” in the Programme. I was involved in the EGU CR team several years and I know that we put a lot of effort in these events to make them fun and allow people to get to know each other and network properly. I am sure that all divisions will come up with something nice and I strongly recommend that you check these out!\
You can for example check out the "First-time attendee Networking".\
There are also more spontaneous events, which you can find here in the Pop-Up Networking events list. Check it out!

Make breaks!
------------
There are so many things happening at EGU that you could easily spend the week in the convention center non-stop. However, your brain is very probably not ready for this. Look at your personal programme regularly and prioritise the programme points so that you know when it would not be too bad to do a break, make a nap, go out to catch some fresh air, .... Take care of yourselves! EGU in person is exhausting! :)\
I also heard that some mindfulness events might be taking place so look out for them :)
