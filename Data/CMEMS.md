## CMEMS

aka Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service aka Copernicus Marine Service.
You'll find all kind of data over there: https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/products

To download it efficiently, you can use the brand new Copernicus Marine Toolboxâ„¢.
All the information about it can be found in the (quite extensive) [documentation](https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/articles/7949409-copernicus-marine-toolbox-introduction).

Watch out: the latest version is `copernicusmarine`, **not** `copernicus-marine-client`.
Also this has replaced `motu`, goodbye Motu, you will not be missed.

### Some tips

Begin by `copernicusmarine login` and enter your username and password, this will save them in an encrypted file so you don't have to re-enter them each time.

This might be useful: [variables glossary](https://marine.copernicus.eu/glossary)

Watch out for the difference between the **product** and the **dataset**. For instance [here](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/SST_GLO_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_024/description) the product-id is `SST_GLO_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_024`. We can spot it in the url, and in the classification section.
This product contains two datasets: `C3S-GLO-SST-L4-REP-OBS-SST` and `ESACCI-GLO-SST-L4-REP-OBS-SST`, you can explore them in the map thing (in 'layers', click the top arrow to show the button).
They are also listed if you go to "Data access" on the left.

### Subset multifiles

You may want to use the subset command (to extract a sub-region, or only certain variables, etc.) but it will concatenate everything in a single Netcdf file (if you are using Netcdf and not Zarr in which case this does not concern you), but you may want to have daily files, or weekly files, or whatever-frequency-files.
I got you: [this script](./copernicusmarine-subset-multifile.py) extend the command to automatically make multiple calls and save the file into whatever path you need them.
*Warning though, it's not thoroughly tested.*

### Mask and flags

You may come across a variable named 'mask' or 'flags' with weird values and more importantly, attributes like `flag_values`, `flag_meanings`, or `flag_masks`.
This is a special way to encode multiple flag variables into one (to save disk space). It is described in the [CF convention](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.11/cf-conventions.html#flags), and you can retrieve the information by using the [cf-xarray](https://cf-xarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flags.html) package.

If you want to avoid a full package and understand the encoding, you can always retrieve information with a couple of simple bitwise operations, check out [cf-xarray's code](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/cf-xarray/blob/main/cf_xarray/accessor.py#L2898) for an example (maybe not the most readable).
