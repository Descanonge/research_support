## High-res satellite photographs

This is mostly for fun, here are a couple of places where you can find some beautiful images.
But also some tools that can let you explore maybe more useful data.

- On https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov you will find a new image *every day* taken either from a satellite or astronauts in the ISS. It is also accompanied by an explanatory text. You can find the high-resolution versions of those images on https://visibleearth.nasa.gov. And since they have been doing this for decades now this is a huge collections of nice wallpapers üòÅ.

- The ESA is doing something similar with [Observing the Earth](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth). A bit more sparse but be sure to check Sentinel images, the zoom feature they have makes it all the more impressive.

- Here are all the photos taken by astronauts! https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/SearchPhotos/

- You can explore for yourself the images of the various Sentinel satellites at https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/browser (you might have to create an account).
  Maybe of most interest the true color from Sentinel-2, for some stunning images (its bands have resolutions between 10m and 60m!).
  
- And even more data from the NASA: https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data. Maybe especially using the [Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/).
