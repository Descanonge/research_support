## Editors

Don't hesitate to add software that you think is missing in this section.

### IDE

Let's begin by defining what is an IDE: Integrated Development Environment. A software to write code that has plenty of tools to help you: smart completion, linting (check your code for syntax errors), compilation, git integration, etc.
There are generally only made for one specific language, but quite powerful.
- Spyder: for Python
- Rstudio: for R
- Matlab
- TexStudio: for LaTeX
- CodeBlocks: for C, C++, Fortran
Jupyter lab could count as an IDE.

All of those are great but some prefer to do everything in the same software, not change editor depending on the language.
Generally you add features by adding plugins that make your editor IDE-like.
Same features, sometime even better and more configurable, but not necessarily as streamlined. Stuff might not work from time to time.

Gedit: pretty basic, generally available, can be extended somewhat.
Notepad++: ?

### Code editors

#### Visual Studio

Now we are left with the big contenders.
Visual Studio is a code editor developed by Microsoft, with plenty of plugins that are mostly developed by the community.
It has lots of users, is easily customizable, and plugins can add some impressive features. Definitely a good choice if you don't want to spend *too* much time on setting your editor up.
Because it's made by Microsoft (which owns github), and is based on web technology, you can connect it to your github projects easily and run stuff on github servers (look at github Codespaces for instance).

#### Vim

The next two editors are somewhat special. Vim and Emacs have been around for some time (this is an understatement, there are probably the oldest user software still widely in use), and can be quite daunting to get into. But if you don't mind an all-keyboard interface, and spending some time in their innings (or even like it) the reward is pretty good.

Note that you can still use them "vanilla", without (too much) plugins or configuration, they are still *very* good.

Let's start with Vim quickly, the best text-editor around!
It is probably already on your machine (it is everywhere!). It is a terminal software (though there exist GUI like vim-gtk): so let's open a terminal and edit a document: `vim mydoc.txt`.
Vim normally opens in **normal mode**, where the keys do not insert characters, but execute actions.
If we want to write a sentence, we press **i** to go into **insert mode**, now we can write whatever we want and press **escape** to go back to normal mode.
Some examples of actions include:
- gg: go to the top of the file
- 0: go to the beginning of the line
- w: go to the beginning of the next word
- cw: remove the text up to the next word and go into insert mode
- etc.

You can find more information there: https://vimhelp.org/.
Plenty of plugins exists that can extend its features close to an IDE (see [neovim](https://neovim.io/)).

This is an odd system for sure, and requires some learning but it can be done little by little and soon you will be able to edit a text blazingly fast with a couple of keystrokes.
It is also a good way to edit a file from a terminal quickly, even on a remote machine.

#### Emacs

Last but not least is Emacs. It is closer to a standard editor, with plenty of chord-like keybindings. For instance to save the current file you type Ctrl-F then Ctrl-S.
Just as is, it is a powerful editor with plenty of keybindings, which you can use without much additional configuration.

But the real magic of Emacs is the way it works: like any software Emacs is a collection of variables and functions. Well, **all** its variables and functions are accessible to the user.
And it is **made** for you to change the values of variables (this is how you configure it), or re-define functions to your liking.
That make it very easy to extend: it is self documented (and really well documented), and you can make changes while it is running!
Want proof? The community re-implemented Vim in Emacs, so with just a plugin you can use Vim modal editing in Emacs (and then you don't have to learn Emacs ...*controversial* keybindings)!

This makes for an infinitely customizable editor, as powerful as you make it. You still have to learn how Emacs works (but again it is well [documented](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/emacs.html)), and more importantly learn a bit of [**elisp**](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html), the language used to extend Emacs, which frankly is a bit weird at first.

So turning it into an IDE from the ground up is not that easy, but some projects have created "Emacs distributions" with modules that you can simply deÂ·activate. They will get you started in no time: [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) and [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/)
