Creating illustrations or posters to convey your story is a recurring task when communicating at seminars or in scientific publications. To achieve impactful visuals, you often find yourself using illustration software. Based on experience, there are several software options available that can serve this purpose. It is important to note that there is no definitive best choice, as it depends on factors such as the complexity of the software, the type of data, and the intended illustrations.

Based on experience, here are some software names that can help you in this endeavor. When seeking new ideas, explore graphic galleries as well.
- **Inkscape**: This software offers a free license and is highly versatile. While it may seem overwhelming at first, it allows for the manipulation of SVG files and the use of masks.
- **GIMP**: Another free software, GIMP is powerful and efficient. However, it may be challenging to fully utilize at the beginning due to its complexity.
- Any programming language such as **Python**, **Matlab**, or **R Studio**: These languages can be utilized for creating visuals programmatically, offering flexibility and customization.
- **Keynote**, **Microsoft PowerPoint**, or **LibreOffice**: Sometimes, simplicity is key. These presentation software options can be efficient for creating straightforward and visually appealing illustrations or slides.
- **ParaView**: This software offers a free license and is both versatile and powerful. It allows for the visualization of complex arrays of data, although it may be challenging to use initially.

It's important to note that PDF files are typically lighter than PNG or JPEG images, which can significantly reduce the size of your manuscript (but unfortunately not your humor). Additionally, PDF images can be manually edited within any editor using SVG files, as they are scriptable objects (useful when in the rush for a presentation).
